# MasterPoker

Master Poker is a poker engine created to be open source and easy to use so that anyone can use it to make projects.


### Installing

To install this software, clone the repo. We currently only support windows, but if you want to create a makefile there is no OS dependent code. 

## Running the tests

Set the startup project to "Tests" and run. This requires [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) to be setup, tho boost is not a requirement for the library itself.
